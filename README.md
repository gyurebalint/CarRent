# CarRent

This is a windows form app for a Rent-A-Car shop where the shop's administrator can record and follow the cars and deals the shop made.
In the main form ('form1') you can see the summmary of all rented-out cars at the moment. On the top-left settings you can upload new cars, your customers and sales people and
new deals these sale people made. You can associate multiple cars to deals and cannot rent a car if it is already rented.

The app uses a local MySql database connection.
